According to the World Health Organization, psychiatric health is a state wherein a person understands their potential and has the ability to deal with regular stresses of life. In addition, the person has the ability to work in a productive manner and can make a meaningful contribution to his community.
So, if you are wondering why is mental health important, you now know that you need to be mentally healthy to achieve your potential and be productive in the society you live and work in. Without sound mental health, you will never be able to cope with daily life stresses and this will, in turn, affect your ability to stay productive.<br/>
A psychiatric health check up helps diagnose treatable mental conditions. Any warning sign can be diagnosed early on and you can receive appropriate treatment for it. Psychiatric illnesses like Depression, Schizophrenia and Anxiety are widespread in todayâ€™s highly competitive world. There also are many people suffering from schizophrenia. These psychiatric health issues, if not treated, can result in hospitalization.

Unfortunately, even today, psychiatric illness is stigmatized in the society. This is the reason a lot of people avoid a psychiatric health check up. But if you want optimal emotional wellbeing, this is one health checkup you should never sideline.
